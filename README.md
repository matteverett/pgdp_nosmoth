### Project manager notes ###

This project uses the [long-s](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofing_old_texts#Long_s>long-s), which should be proofed as a regular s. If the OCR read a word starting with f, but the word would also be valid if that were an s, guiprep will have replaced the f with \*. P1 should replace the \* with either f or s. Thus fame would be replaced with *ame, since it could have been same with a long-s (ſame).

It has [catchwords](https://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#next_word>Catchwords), which should be deleted. There is no markup needed for ct or st ligatures.

When using wordcheck, if a word or part of a word appears on the page, it is OK to suggest it.

The "Nosmoth" (Thomson backwards) in the title refers to Dr Thomas Thompson, the Mandarin Tonwin is [Thomas Winnington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)).

Goettingen has this as "[2],5-29,[1]p ; 8°", Yale have it as "1 p. l., 5-29 p. 21 cm.", BAnQ have it as "[2],5-29,[1]p. ; in-8°.". Nothing is missing.
