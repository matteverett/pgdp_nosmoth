<HTML><BODY><p>This project uses the <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:Proofreading/Proofing_old_texts#Long_s&gt;long-s">long-s</a>, which should be proofed as a regular s. If the OCR read a word starting with f, but the word would also be valid if that were an s, guiprep will have replaced the f with *. P1 should replace the * with either f or s. Thus fame would be replaced with *ame, since it could have been same with a long-s (ſame).</p>
<p>It has <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#next_word&gt;Catchwords">catchwords</a>, which should be deleted. There is no markup needed for ct or st ligatures.</p>
<p>When using wordcheck, if a word or part of a word appears on the page, it is OK to suggest it.</p>
<p>The "Nosmoth" (Thomson backwards) in the title refers to Dr Thomas Thompson, the Mandarin Tonwin is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Winnington_(1696%E2%80%931746)">Thomas Winnington</a>.</p>
<p>Goettingen has this as "[2],5-29,[1]p ; 8°", Yale have it as "1 p. l., 5-29 p. 21 cm.", BAnQ have it as "[2],5-29,[1]p. ; in-8°.". Nothing is missing.</p></BODY></HTML>
